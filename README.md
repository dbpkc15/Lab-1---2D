# Lab-1---2D
My Homework
My 2D project is set in a green field with bright blue skies. There is a beautiful home that sits in the field with a cat sleeping on the front porch. There are also different sections of green trees. I am still feeling a little uneasy with coding, but I believe I did the assignment correct. I was confused a couple of times, but as I played through with the system, it got easier for me.
